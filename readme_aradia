## **Project Description**
This storymap presentation was created for Clean Water Services to showcase their Pure Water Brew competition at the
International Singapore Water Week 2018. Clean Water Services is changing the conversation around water reuse. This
storymap documents how that story has evolved since 2012, and is an extension of the Clean Water Services website. It is
meant to be an engaging, educational, and approachable interface.
