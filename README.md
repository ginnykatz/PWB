**Motives**


This story map aims to engage an audience in the story of Pure Water Brew and
the evolving conversation surrounding water reuse. Based on the actions of Clean
Water Services in Hillsboro Oregon, this engagement tool will be used as presentation
support in the International Singapore Water Week 2018 and will further serve
as a website extension for the Clean Water Services Website. 



**Project Description**


This multimedia story map will use the video template for of Dr. Zhao’s story
map examples, located at [link]. This story map will include interactive maps,
videos, images, graphic design, D3 Geovisual analytics (Heatmaps, Twitter Word
Clouds, Hexagonal Cholopleth Map). These charts and data displays will mainly
focus on the changing conversation surrounding Pure Water Brew and water reuse.

Design goals will utilize the Pure Water Brew logo color scheme, also featured in their website : https://www.purewaterbrew.org/
